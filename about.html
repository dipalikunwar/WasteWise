      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        WasteWise is a community-driven platform designed to make waste collection and cleanliness management smarter, transparent, and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens can track local garbage truck schedules, report uncollected waste with photos, and monitor their area’s cleanliness score. Our goal is to promote cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable neighborhoods.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built WasteWise</h2>
      <p>
        In many cities, waste management suffers due to poor communication between citizens and local authorities. WasteWise bridges this gap by connecting people directly with municipal waste teams through an easy-to-use digital interface.
